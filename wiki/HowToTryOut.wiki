= How to Try Out =

  # Install Eclipse SDK 3.4.2 or 3.5.0.
  # Install SVN Eclipse integration from http://subversion.tigris.org/ to be able to download samples later.
  # Download the ohl patch jar file (one with matching version) from "Downloads"
  # Run Eclipse as
{{{
Eclipse.exe -dev patch_file_name.jar
}}}
  # In the running Eclipse import java projects into your workspace from https://ohl.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/samples SVN URL. It should be a sample project and important _ohl_rt_ library project. One depends on another.
  # Try to play with it.
  # Try basic features: [LangEnumCase enum-case declaration], [LangSwitch switch operator], [LangUserType user types] and [LangTuple tuples].
  # Try advanced features: [LangEnumCaseExtends enum-case extension], [LangGenericEnumCase generic enum-cases], [LangTypeParam enum-case as a generic type], [LangVariance variance], [LangReflection reflection].
  # Feel free to write me if you have thoughts or there are problems. See also [Discussion comments].
