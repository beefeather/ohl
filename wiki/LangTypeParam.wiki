= Enum-case as a generic type parameter =

Like any other type, enum-case type may be used as a generic parameter. However, enum-case type has a mandatory ".case" suffix and you may choose put it inside parameter or not.

{{{
class CaseHolder<T> {
  T caseInstance;
}

CaseHolder<FewOptions.case> holder = new CaseHolder<FewOptions.case>();
holder.caseInstance = FewOptions.doNothing;
}}}

===Type parameter does not include .case===
{{{
class CaseHolder<P> {
  P.case caseInstance;
}

CaseHolder<FewOptions> holder = new CaseHolder<FewOptions>();
holder.caseInstance = FewOptions.doNothing;
}}}
